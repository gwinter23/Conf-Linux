I am in want to share to get SSL public for you on smal enfironment or lab testing 

Requirement 
You are must have a domain
and public ip to try this command and generate SSL 

you can use this command on your server,for me i tested on ubuntu server 20.04 lts 

#certbot certonly -d console.gwinter.tech 

#ls -lsb /etc/letsencrypt/live/console.gwinter.tech/

generaly you can get ssl in standart .pem or .crt
you can directly use this cert for you service ex web service 


for HA proxy you can combine certificate file and certificate key on one single file SSL 

#cd /etc/letsencrypt/live/console.gwinter.tech/

#cat cert.pem privkey.pem > all.pem
